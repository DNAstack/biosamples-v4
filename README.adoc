# Development getting started

## Install the dependencies
To checkout and compile the code, you will need Git, Maven, and a JDK 8.
On ubuntu-based Linux distributions (16.04 or higher) you can do this
with:

`sudo apt-get install maven git default-jdk`

You should now being able to check out the code from GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/EBIBioSamples/biosamples-v4 biosamples`

In order to create a local instance of BioSamples services you need to have Docker and Docker-compose installed on you machine. Check out https://www.docker.com/community-edition and https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ to know how to install these services on your machine.

## Startup the local version of the BioSamples services
Go to the biosamples folder. Run the script that will compile the java application and start up the docker containers using `docker-webapp.sh`.

*Note*: This will require a large download of Spring dependencies and Docker containers and could be a lengthy process depending on your connection.

## Check status ##
Head to http://localhost:8081/biosamples to see your local version of the services. Note that no samples is directly provided with this development version and therefore no results will be shown in the "Search" page.

# What to do now

A test file, `sample_example.json`, is available in this repo.

We would like you to **submit this sample to your local Biosamples environment using the BioSamples JSON API**. 

You can find more details on how to do this in the reference guide that is available in your local copy of BioSamples. Feel free to use commands like `curl` or `httpie` or software like Postman to get the task done.
