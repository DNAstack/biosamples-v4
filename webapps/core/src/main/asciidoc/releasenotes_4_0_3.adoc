4.0.3
-----

This is a bugfix release that addresses the following issues:

* Forward legacy group URLs /biosamples/groups/SAMEGxxxx to /biosamples/samples/SAMEGxxxxx
* Missing or malformed update and release date on legacy XML group submission will default to current datetime. It is not recommended that users intentionally rely on this.
* Index legacy XML group submissions, which was not happening due to an unexpected consequence of the interaction of components. 
* Redirect /biosamples/sample and /biosamples/group URLs in case of typo
