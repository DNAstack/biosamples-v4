==SampleTab MSI section

The MSI (Meta-submission information) is based on rows. The first column specifies a key and subsequent columns the values. There are 6 sections, described below. All MSI sections are block based; entries in the same column within the same section are related, but the order of the rows is not important. The start of the MSI section is denoted by "[MSI]" on a line by itself.

===Submission

The submission block describes overall features of the submission and its associated samples.
